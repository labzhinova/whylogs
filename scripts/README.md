# Scripts

## Profiler
`profiler.py` contains an executable command line script for running whylogs on an input CSV file.
Make sure `whylogs-python` is installed to your python environment.

Some commands:
* Display help: ```./profiler.py -h```
* Run on the first 5 lines of a file: ```./profiler.py -l 5 data/lending-club-accepted-10.csv```
